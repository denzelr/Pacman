Left to Complete: I still need to add the players score and lives left to a HUD. 

I also need to add collision with walls and the balls. I have a decent solution to the collision with the balls but I am not certain how to stop pacman from wandering through the walls. 

A success condition when all the balls are collected and the level is complete needs to be added.

If time allows, I will explore SDL to add sound effects to the game. 

Time Worked: ~20 hours
